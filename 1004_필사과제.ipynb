with leather seats .\\n17                                                                                                                                                               Only needs to

drove an EX, L and felt the seats were too firm plus, the EX, L seemed too slow .\\n21

.\\n29                                                                                                                              The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                            It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

floor was OK, but during our stay, the lobby was always really full of other guests .\\n80

whole room, the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated .\\n81

service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of Chicago !\\n83

with the service, location, as well as the room and its view .\\n84

unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services .\\n85

utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center .\\n86

  The room was nice, but the service was horriable .\\n87

I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .\\n88

Michigan Ave, Room service was superb   .\\n89

was not serviced when I returned .\\n90

stand to improve its service .\\n91

                                       That and also the free coffee and tea   every morning were little extras that we felt made you feel like a welcomed guest and that they are going out of their

ask both mornings for hot chocolate to be brought out for the kids, and the advertised biscotti was no where to be found .\\n25

hour, which we enjoyed .\\n26                                                                                                          Coffee and biscotti were available in reception every morning

very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive .\\n12

back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                            It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

push power on the remote and has free internet service .\\n49                                                                   no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .\\n50

Palm restaurant and they would bill it to our room .\\n51                                 30 and they said we needed a voucher and mentioned nothing of room service, we did get the voucher and enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet in their 2nd restaurant, not the Palm like we were toldWhen we were checking out we asked why we got charged for the pool when it states the package comes with it and it says in their books in the room that its free .\\n52

it is by how ornate the lobby decor is .\\n53

this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the

comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34

minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35

                                               The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32

               I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

                                                             The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

                                                                                                   The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

       Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

                                                               Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97

and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100

                                                 My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102

                                                                           Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107

                                                                                                                                                       Top notch rating on interior comfort .\\n109

                                                                                                                                     So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                           Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42

                                                                                                                                          I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

Initial gas mileage looks good too .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage .\\n46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

                                                                It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great

OK  , but not as good as Honda advertises .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage is wonderful, 1st tank 26 mpg with almost all city driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52

I got .\\n54                                                                                                                                          I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .\\n55                                                                                                                                                     It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57

                                                                                                                                                                  Some reviewers were complaining about

is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62

                                                                                                                       I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71

                                                                                                                                             The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or

life, but I've only charged it once and that was on the computer  as far as I've seen my computer doen't charge well with either of my iPods so the battery life is possibly greater than I thought if using a wall outlet .\\n33

you use it constantly like i do it only last about 4 or 5 hours not a big deal though .\\n35

                                             If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n24

  The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n27

        My only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .\\n32

doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33

                                                Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n45

matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

.\\n47

                                             And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

                                      I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54

for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

conditions .\\n57

One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

           you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                                              Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

                                       I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as

you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                       The Garmin Nuvi 255W connects to satellites extremely fast, , So when I get in my car and turn it on, we're pretty much ready to go immediately .\\n2

animation maybe 6, 8 frames a second ?\\n3

                                                                                                    The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .\\n5

tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                 I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9

                                   I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about

in your room after a night on the town .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                      Breakfast equally tired ,  although a reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel .\\n12

.\\n17                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n18

close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19                                                                                                                                              Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

   There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

     The bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by .\\n41

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

was the wrong order .\\n50

                                                                                                                                                                                  While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .\\n52

                                      I can't comment on any of the hotel restaurants or food as we never ate there with so many other choices nearby .\\n62

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68                                                                                                                                      there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                            More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                             Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n71

                                                                                               The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29                                                                                                                                                                               As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Disappointing given the prices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                              Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Should have been priced at $250  .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .\\n71

                                                     Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the

you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70

when one could meet other guests .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?\\n72

                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n74

jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .\\n77

                                                                                                   We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                               Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n80

               The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36

                                  There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40

duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches

be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

as there was no information about that anywhere .\\n74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we

I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .\\n84

                                                           When we finally found the church later, the service times she had given us were wrong, too .\\n87                                                                                                                           Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n88                                                                                                                           The hotel is pretty much as you'd

good .\\n90

charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n93

                                                          And the hotel restaurant food and service was   awful .\\n124

&quot room service&quot  came from a nearby pizzeria, but the hotel still charged a fee on each delivery .\\n138

information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9

often the map updates even when sitting still .\\n10                                                                                                                           Upon plugging my Nuvi

about 2GB in size .\\n13                                                                                                                  I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of

because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc .\\n16

                                I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option

that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n36

                                                                    All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6

having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13

                                          The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .\\n18

a blown speaker .\\n19

               Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24

and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25

voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n75

                                                                                                                                                                                    The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                   Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n86                                                                                            The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cluster_label\",\n
